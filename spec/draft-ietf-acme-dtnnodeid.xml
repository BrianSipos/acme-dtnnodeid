This document specifies an extension to the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol which allows an ACME server to validate the Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Node ID for an ACME client.
The DTN Node ID is encoded as a certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of type Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and ACME Identifier type "uri".

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
Although the original purpose of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) <xref target="RFC8555"/> was to allow Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) certificate authorities to validate network domain names of clients, the same mechanism can be used to validate any of the subject claims supported by the PKIX profile <xref target="RFC5280"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
In the case of this specification, the claim being validated is a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of type Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) used to represent the Node ID of a Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Node.
A DTN Node ID is a URI with a specific set of allowed schemes, and determines how bundles are routed within a DTN.
Currently the schemes "dtn" and "ipn" as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/> are valid for a Node ID.
      </t>
      <t>
Once an ACME server validates a Node ID, either as a pre-authorization of the "uri" or as one of the authorizations of an order containing a "uri", the client can finalize the order using an associated certificate signing request (CSR).
Because a single order can contain multiple identifiers of multiple types, there can be operational issues for a client attempting to, and possibly failing to, validate those multiple identifiers as described in <xref target="sec-multiple-claims"/>.
Once a certificate is issued for a Node ID, how the ACME client configures the Bundle Protocol (BP) agent with the new certificate is an implementation matter.
      </t>
      <t>
The scope and behavior of this validation mechanism is similar to that of secured email validation of <xref target="RFC8823"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
This document also updates BPv7 to explicitly use the IANA administrative record type registry in <xref target="sec-bpv7-admin-type"/>.

The basic unit of data exchange in a DTN is a Bundle <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>, which consists of a data payload with accompanying metadata.
An Endpoint ID is used as the destination of a Bundle and can indicate both a unicast or a multicast destination.
A Node ID is used to identify the source of a Bundle and is used for routing through intermediate nodes, including the final node(s) used to deliver a Bundle to its destination endpoint.
A Node ID can also be used as an endpoint for administrative bundles.
More detailed descriptions of the rationale and capabilities of these networks can be found in "Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture" <xref target="RFC4838"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
When a ACME client requests a pre-authorization or an order with a "uri" having one of the DTN Node ID schemes, the ACME server offers a challenge type to validate that Node ID.
If the ACME client attempts the authorization challenge to validate a Node ID, the ACME server sends an ACME Node ID Validation Challenge Bundle with a destination of the Node ID being validated.
The BP agent on that node receives the Challenge Bundle, generates an ACME key authorization digest, and sends an ACME Node ID Validation Response Bundle in reply.
An Integrity Gateway on the client side of the DTN can be used to attest to the source of the Response Bundle.
Finally, the ACME server receives the Response Bundle and checks that the digest was generated for the associated ACME challenge and from the client account key associated with the original request.
This workflow is shown in the diagram of <xref target="fig-entity-relations"/> and defined in <xref target="sec-validate-nodeid"/>.

        <t>
Because the DTN Node ID is used both for routing bundles between BP agents and for multiplexing administrative services within a BP agent, there is no possibility to separate the ACME validation of a Node ID from normal bundle handling for that same Node ID.
This leaves administrative record types as a way to leave the Node ID unchanged while disambiguating from other service data bundles.
        </t>
        <t>
There is nothing in this protocol which requires network-topological co-location of either the ACME client or ACME server with their associated BP agent.
While ACME requires a low-enough latency network to perform HTTPS exchanges between ACME client and server, the client's BP agent (the one being validated) could be on the far side of a long-delay or multi-hop DTN network.
The means by which the ACME client or server communicates with its associated BP agent is an implementation matter.

      <name>URI ACME Identifier</name>
      <t>
This specification is the first to make use of a URI to identify a service for a certificate request in ACME.
The URI-type identifier is general purpose, and validating ownership of a URI requires a specific purpose related to its "scheme" component.
In this document, the only purpose for which a URI ACME identifier is validated is as a DTN Node ID (see <xref target="sec-validate-nodeid"/>), but other specifications can define challenge types for other URI uses.
      </t>
      <t>
Identifiers of type "uri" in certificate requests MUST appear in an extensionRequest attribute <xref target="RFC2985"/> containing a subjectAltName extension of type uniformResourceIdentifier having a value consistent with the requirements of <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
Because the uniformResourceIdentifier is encoded as an IA5String it SHALL be treated as being in the percent-encoded form of <xref section="2.1" target="RFC3986"/>.
Any "uri" identifier which fails to properly percent-decode SHALL be rejected with an ACME error type of "malformed".
      </t>
      <t>
Identifiers of type "uri" present in ACME messages are unicode text strings and SHALL NOT be percent encoded.
      </t>
      <t>
The ACME server SHALL decode and normalize (based on scheme-specific syntax) all received identifiers of type "uri".
Any "uri" identifier request which uses a scheme not handled by the ACME server or for which the URI does not match the scheme-specific syntax SHALL be rejected with an ACME error type of "rejectedIdentifier".
      </t>
      <t>
When an ACME server needs to request proof that a client controls a URI, it SHALL create an authorization with the identifier type "uri".
The ACME server SHALL NOT attempt to dereference the URI value on its own.
It is the responsibility of a validation method to ensure the URI ownership via scheme-specific means authorized by the ACME client.

      <name>DTN Node ID Validation</name>
      <t>
The DTN Node ID validation method proves control over a Node ID by requiring the ACME client to configure a BP agent to respond to specific Challenge Bundles sent from the ACME server.
The ACME server validates control of the Node ID URI by verifying that received Response Bundles correspond with the BP Node and client account key being validated.
      </t>
      <t>
Similar to the ACME use case for validating email address ownership <xref target="RFC8823"/>, this challenge splits the token into several parts, each being transported by a different channel, and the Key Authorization result requires combining all parts of the token.
The token parts are:
      </t>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <tt>token-chal</tt>
        </dt>
        <dd>
This token is unique to, and constant for, each ACME authorization.
It is contained in the Challenge Object of <xref target="sec-nodeid-challenge-request"/> as well as the Challenge Bundle of <xref target="sec-bundle-challenge"/>.
It ensures that the Key Authorization is bound to the specific ACME challenge (and parent ACME authorization) and also allows the ACME client's BP agent to filter-in only valid Challenge Bundles.
This token is also accessible to DTN on-path eavesdroppers.
        </dd>

This token is also accessible to DTN on-path eavesdroppers.

The DTN Node ID Challenge SHALL only be allowed for URIs usable as a DTN Node ID, which are currently the schemes "dtn" and "ipn" as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>.
When an ACME server supports Node ID validation, the ACME server SHALL define a challenge object in accordance with <xref target="sec-nodeid-challenge-request"/>.
Once this challenge object is defined, the ACME client may begin the validation.

      <t>
To initiate a Node ID validation, the ACME client performs the following steps:
      </t>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
The ACME client POSTs a newOrder or newAuthz request including the identifier of type "uri" for the desired Node ID.
From either of these entry points an authorization for the "uri" type is indicated by the ACME server.
See <xref section="7.4" target="RFC8555"/> for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
The ACME client obtains the challenge source Node ID and <tt>token-chal</tt> from the challenge object in accordance with <xref target="sec-nodeid-challenge-request"/>.

        <li anchor="step-client-authorize">
The ACME client indicates to the administrative element of its BP agent the source Node ID and challenge <tt>token-chal</tt> which is authorized for use and the associated client account key thumbprint.
The ACME client SHALL wait, if necessary, until the agent is configured before proceeding to the next step.
        </li>
        <li>
The ACME client POSTs a challenge response to the challenge URL on the ACME server accordance with <xref section="7.5.1" target="RFC8555"/>.
The payload object is constructed in accordance with <xref target="sec-nodeid-challenge-response"/>.
        </li>
        <li>
The administrative element waits for a Challenge Bundle to be received with the authorized ACME parameters, including its <tt>token-bundle</tt> payload, in accordance with <xref target="sec-bundle-challenge"/>.
        </li>
        <li>
The administrative element concatenates <tt>token-bundle</tt> with <tt>token-chal</tt> (each as base64url-encoded text strings) and computes the Key Authorization in accordance with <xref section="8.1" target="RFC8555"/> using the full token and client account key thumbprint.
        </li>
        <li>
The administrative element computes the SHA-256 digest of the Key Authorization result and generates a Response Bundle to send back to the ACME server in accordance with <xref target="sec-bundle-response"/>.
        </li>
        <li>
The ACME client waits for the authorization to be finalized on the ACME server in accordance with <xref section="7.5.1" target="RFC8555"/>.
        </li>
        <li>
Once the challenge is completed (successfully or not), the ACME client indicates to the BP agent that the validation source and <tt>token-chal</tt> is no longer usable.

The ACME server sends, via the administrative element of its BP agent, one or more Challenge Bundles in accordance with <xref target="sec-bundle-challenge"/>.
Each challenge bundle SHALL contain a distinct <tt>token-bundle</tt> to be able to correlate with a response bundle.
Computing an expected Key Authorization digest is not necessary until a response is received.

Once received and decoded, the ACME server checks the contents of each Response Bundle in accordance with <xref target="sec-response-check"/>.
After all Challenge Bundles have either been responded to or timed-out, the validation procedure is successful only if all responses are successful.

An ACME server MAY send multiple challenges from different origins in the DTN network to avoid possible on-path attacks, as recommended in <xref section="10.2" target="RFC8555"/>.

        <t>
A challenge response is not sent until the BP agent has been configured to properly respond to the challenge, so the RTT value is meant to indicate any node-specific path delays expected to encountered from the ACME server.
Because there is no requirement on the path (or paths) which bundles may traverse between the ACME server and the BP agent, and the ACME server can attempt some path diversity, the RTT value SHOULD be pessimistic.
        </t>
        <t>
A default bundle response interval, used when the object does not contain an RTT, SHOULD be a configurable parameter of the ACME server.
If the ACME client indicated an RTT value in the object, the response interval SHOULD be twice the RTT (with limiting logic applied as described below).
The lower limit on response interval is network-specific, but SHOULD NOT be shorter than one second.
The upper limit on response interval is network-specific, but SHOULD NOT be longer than one minute (60 seconds) for a terrestrial-only DTN.

This section defines a BIB use which closely resembles the function of DKIM email signing <xref target="RFC6376"/>.
In this mechanism a routing node in a DTN sub-network attests to the origination of a bundle by adding a BIB before forwarding it.
The bundle receiver then need not trust the source of the bundle, but only trust this security source node.
The receiver needs policy configuration to know which security sources are permitted to attest for which bundle sources.

An integrity gateway SHALL validate the Source Node ID of a bundle, using local-network-specific means, before adding a BIB to the bundle.
The exact means by which an integrity gateway validates a bundle's source is network-specific, but could use physical-layer, network-layer or BP-convergence-layer authentication.
The bundle source could also add its own BIB with a local-network-specific security context or local-network-specific key material (i.e. a group key shared within the local network).

These purposes are referred to here as bundle security certificates.

      <t>
One defining aspect of bundle security certificates is the Extended Key Usage key purpose "id-kp-bundleSecurity" of <xref target="IANA-SMI"/>.
When requesting a certificate which includes a Node ID SAN, the CSR SHOULD include an Extended Key Usage of id-kp-bundleSecurity.
When a bundle security certificate is issued based on a validated Node ID SAN, the certificate SHALL include an Extended Key Usage of id-kp-bundleSecurity.

      <section anchor="sec-multiple-claims">
        <name>Multiple Identity Claims</name>
        <t>
A single bundle security CSR MAY contain a mixed set of SAN claims, including combinations of "ip", "dns", and "uri" claims.
There is no restriction on how a certificate combines these claims, but each claim MUST be validated by an ACME server to issue such a certificate as part of an associated ACME order.
This is no different than the existing behavior of <xref target="RFC8555"/> but is mentioned here to make sure that CA policy handles such situations; especially related to validation failure of an identifier in the presence of multiple identifiers.
The specific use case of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-tcpclv4"/> allows, and for some network policies requires, that a certificate authenticate both the DNS name of an entity as well as the Node ID of the entity.

ACME extensions specified in this document can be used to request encryption-only or signing-only bundle security certificates.
        </t>
        <t>
In order to request signing only bundle security certificate, the CSR MUST include the key usage extension with digitalSignature and/or nonRepudiation bits set and no other bits set.

In order to request encryption only bundle security certificate, the CSR MUST include the key usage extension with keyEncipherment or keyAgreement bits set and no other bits set.

        <t>
Presence of both of the above sets of key usage bits in the CSR, as well as absence of key usage extension in the CSR, signals to ACME server to issue a bundle security certificate suitable for both signing and encryption.

        <name>Threat: Passive Leak of Validation Data</name>
        <t>
Because this challenge mechanism is used to bootstrap security between DTN Nodes, the challenge and its response are likely to be transferred in plaintext.
The only ACME data present on-the-wire is a random token and a cryptographic digest, so there is no sensitive data to be leaked within the Node ID Validation bundle exchange.
Because each challenge uses a separate token, there is no value in an on-path attacker seeing the tokens from past challenges and/or responses.
        </t>
        <t>
It is possible for intermediate BP nodes to encapsulate-and-encrypt Challenge and/or Response Bundles while they traverse untrusted networks, but that is a DTN configuration matter outside of the scope of this document.

        <name>Threat: BP Node Impersonation</name>

As described in <xref section="8.1" target="RFC8555"/>, it is possible for an active attacker to alter data on both ACME client channel and the DTN validation channel.
        </t>
        <t>
The primary mitigation is to delegate bundle integrity sourcing to a trusted routing node near, in the sense of bundle routing topology, to the bundle source node as defined in <xref target="sec-bib-gateway"/>.
This is functionally similar to DKIM signing of <xref target="RFC6376"/> and provides some level of bundle origination.
        </t>
        <t>
Another way to mitigate single-path on-path attacks is to attempt validation of the same Node ID via multiple bundle routing paths, as recommended in <xref target="sec-validate-nodeid"/>.
It is not a trivial task to guarantee bundle routing though, so more advanced techniques such as onion routing (using bundle-in-bundle encapsulation <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bibect"/>) could be employed.

      <section anchor="sec-security-replay">
        <name>Threat: Bundle Replay</name>
        <t>
It is possible for an on-path attacker to replay both Challenge Bundles or Response Bundles.
Even in a properly-configured DTN it is possible that intermediate bundle routers to use multicast forwarding of a unicast-destination bundle.
        </t>
        <t>
Ultimately, the point of the ACME bundle exchange is to derive a Key Authorization and its cryptographic digest and communicate it back to the ACME server for validation, so the uniqueness of the Key Authorization directly determines the scope of replay validity.
The uniqueness of each <tt>token-bundle</tt> to each challenge bundle ensures that the Key Authorization is unique to the challenge bundle.
The uniqueness of each <tt>token-chal</tt> to the ACME challenge ensures that the Key Authorization is unique to that ACME challenge.
        </t>
        <t>
Having each bundle's primary block and payload block covered by a BIB from a trusted security source (see <xref target="sec-bib-gateway"/>) ensures that a replayed bundle cannot be altered in the blocks used by ACME.
All together, these properties mean that there is no degraded security caused by replay of either a Challenge Bundle or a Response Bundle even in the case where the primary or payload block is not covered by a BIB.
The worst that can come of bundle replay is the waste of network resources as described in <xref target="sec-security-dos"/>.

        <t>
The behaviors described in this section all amount to a potential denial-of-service to a BP agent.
        </t>
        <t>
A malicious entity can continually send Challenge Bundles to a BP agent.
The victim BP agent can ignore Challenge Bundles which do not conform to the specific time interval and challenge token for which the ACME client has informed the BP agent that challenges are expected.
The victim BP agent can require all Challenge Bundles to be BIB-signed to ensure authenticity of the challenge.
        </t>
        <t>
A malicious entity can continually send Response Bundles to a BP agent.
The victim BP agent can ignore Response Bundles which do not conform to the specific time interval or Source Node ID or challenge token for an active Node ID validation.
        </t>
        <t>
Similar to other validation methods, an ACME server validating a DTN Node ID could be used as a denial of service amplifier.
For this reason any ACME server can rate-limit validation activities for individual clients and individual certificate requests.

This example is a bundle exchange for the ACME server with Node ID "dtn://acme-server/" performing a verification for ACME client Node ID "dtn://acme-client/".
The example bundles use no block CRC or BPSec integrity, which is for simplicity and is not recommended for normal use.
The provided figures are extended diagnostic notation <xref target="RFC8610"/>.
